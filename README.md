# Team Nameless

Hi! We are team Nameless, comprises Raymond Toh, Shanjie Yong, Damien Cheng and Hoang Viet. We are group of NTU Year 2 Students at the time of this project. 

**_a. Problem Description and proposed idea:_** 

We aim to tackle the issue of climate change and how it affect the performance of our First Responders during training and operations. 
 
**_b. Pitch Video:_**

Our pitch video can be found on Youtube via [this link](https://youtube.com/somelink)

**_c. Architecture of Our Solution:_**

Our architecture is as below:

**_d. Detailed Solution:_**

Detailed solution can be found in this repo under detailed_solution.md
A rough guide to the files in this repo: 
1. Flask-Cloudant: IBM Flask App with Cloudant integration/auth
2. React: React Webapp code 
3. Rpi: calculation of important metrics, code for simulation of sensor data
4. AutoAI: code snippet to enable python to auth with Watson ML 
5. research_background.md: Literature, Inspiration and Hardware specs
6. setup.md: Step-by-step guide to replicate our system on your endpoints 
7. detailed_solution.md: Detailed solution of our problems

**_e. Proposed Timeline:_**

**_g. Running the tests:_**

The detailed setup and running instruction can be found in this repo under setup.md

**_h. Live Demo:_**

The demo video can be found here 

If you would like live demo, download rpi_code into your environment and run the simulation code. Visit demonicmushy.dyndns.org:3000 for the live demo (Hopefully we haven't torn down our project by the time you are reading this D: ) 

**_i. Technology Used:_**
+ IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI and Watson ML
+ IBM Flask App
+ IBM Cloudant
+ IBM Functions (for debugging)
