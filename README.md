# Team Nameless

Hi! We are team Nameless, comprises Raymond Toh, Shanjie Yong, Damien Cheng and Hoang Viet. We are a group of NTU Year 2 Students at the time of this project. 

**_a. Problem Description and proposed idea:_** 

We aim to tackle the issue of climate change and how it affect the performance of our First Responders during training and operations. Our proposed solution is the digitalization of BACO and staging boards to enhance strategic deployment of resources, together with use 3 different sensors to closely monitor first responders physical conditions during training and operation. All data is stored on IBM Cloud and visualized near-realtime on React Webapp.

With this implementation, we can proactively monitor the physical conditions of the first responders and flag out any potential risks. Also, we can reduce stagingâ€™s workload to focus on operationally-oriented tasks.

If you would like to use your own data, download rpi_code into your environment and modify the simulation code to take in your sensors data. Visit demonicmushy.dyndns.org:3000 to see your own data being populated on the BACO Board (Hopefully we haven't torn down our project by the time you are reading this D: ) 


**_i. Technology Used:_**


+ IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI and Watson ML
+ IBM Flask App
+ IBM Cloudant
+ IBM Functions (for debugging)
+ Rpi4, sensors and Python3
+ ReactJS
